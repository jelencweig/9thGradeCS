	<ol>
  		<li>Trim the fat off the beef with a knife. Distribute the sugar evenly on the beef by sprinkling it on each piece. Allow beef to sit for 10 minutes.</li>
  		<li>In a separate bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, sugar, sake, and black pepper. Put aside.</li>
  		<li>Massage the beef with the kiwi juice using your hands. The kiwi works as a tenderizer. Add the soy sauce mixture and mix. Allow the beef to marinate for 10 minutes. Because the beef is thin, it doesn't require a long marinating time. Now it is ready to be barbecued. Ideal if grilled over smoked wood but just as good in a frying pan or skillet. Cook until browned, being careful not to overcook.</li>
  		<li>Last, to prepare dipping sauce, combine all sauce ingredients and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve on the side.</li>
	</ol>
